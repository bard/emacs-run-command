# M-x run-command

Emacs, the text editor that lets you read mail and play Tetris, is often cast in opposition to the Unix philosophy of "do one thing well" and "combine small programs". It's a false dichotomy. Emacs can do a lot on its own _and_ can be combined usefully with other programs.

`run‑command` makes the combination convenient through a simple configuration format and an interaction flow that stays out of your way. Instead of reaching for a shell or a specialized major mode, you give `run‑command` a simple "recipe" and you get a contextual command palette where you can browse, select, and run commands without leaving Emacs.

For demo, quickstart, and advanced configuration, see the [documentation website](bard.github.io/emacs-run-command).
