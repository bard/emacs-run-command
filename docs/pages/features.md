# Features

- **Unopinionated**: run a command against a word, a file, a project, a service, anything.
- **Minimal cognitive tax**: one key binding, one configuration variable.
- **Flexible configuration**: hardcode commands, generate them dynamically based on context, or anything in between.
- **Adapts to your environment**: out of the box support for Helm, Ivy, and `completing-read` selectors, as well as `term-mode`, `vterm`, `eat.el`, and `compilation-mode` runners.
